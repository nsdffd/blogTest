# Node JS using Express as framework and MongoDB as DB.

Just got started with Node JS and really started to like it.

I am using [Codeanywhere here](https://codeanywhere.com/). It is a very good alternative of Amazon's C9.

* Review an existing app (DogDemo)
* Reveiw HTTP response/request lifecycle
* Create a simple Express app!

To run the node your app.js file go to the directory and run `node app.js`

```
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

```
// see this is one of the difference between libraries and framework which is reverse inversion

// when we run simple libraries we can just use something like following e.g.
```
var cat = require("cat-me");
cat();
```
but here, for a big framework like express we cannot do that because of reverse inversion.

```
// "/" => "Hi there!"
app.get("/IntroToExpress/app.js", function(req, res){
  res.send("Hi, there!");
  // some people also use the full word > response and request
  // It does not make any difference
});

app.get("/bye", function(req, res){
  res.send("goodbye!!");
  console.log("Someone said goodbye!");
  // you will get this message in your console when anyone visits this page
})

app.get("/dog", function(req, res){
  res.send("MeoWWWW!!!");
  // thats wicked!
})

app.get("*", function(req, res){
  res.send("Star is undefined ting");
  // this page is for any undefined page
  console.log("Someone is undefined fook!")
  // when anyone visits this page you will get this message in your console
})

```
## Note that here for the * tIng _thats not a typo lol_
// if we put this block of code in the top, when the page loads, we will get the same message of "Stat is undefined ting"

// that is because of route

// when the page runs it will start in chronological order, so if it runs for first parameter, if it suits the criteria it will not proceed or run the next block of codes.

// so the chronology, arrangement and route is important

## lastly we must listen to the server for post request by this for [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com),  it will be different if you run in your local machine:

```
app.listen(3000, function(){
  console.log("server has initiated on port 3000");
});
```

Example of Reddit Subreddit:

How reddit subreddit comments work!

We use a ting called, route parameters or in some other language path parameters or variables as well which is ":"

```
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

// route parameters or route variables, path variables
// multiple slashes

// how reddit subreddit comments work!

// we use a ting called, route parameters which is ":"

// this is a good dynamic website now.
app.get("/r/:subredditName", function(req, res){
     var subreddit = req.params.subredditName;
     res.send("Welcome to " + subreddit +" Subreddit!");
});

app.get("/r/:subredditName/comments/:id/:tittle", function(req,res){
  console.log(req.params);
  res.send("Welcome to the comments page!");
})

app.get("*", function(req, res){
  res.send("Star is undefined fook");
  console.log("Someone is undefined fook!");
})

app.listen(3000, function(){
  console.log("server has started on port 3000");
});

```

This is an example of creating a good dynamic website, where it is a subreddit.

Execute it and go to the website for example in my case it was:

`http://node-rakibfiha2726789.codeanyapp.com:3000/r/BTC`

It will return BTC subreddit.
